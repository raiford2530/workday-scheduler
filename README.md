# workday-scheduler

The Workday Scheduler is an app that can be used to plan out your daily schedule. The scheduler indicates the state of your events by color coding each timeblock. If the event is in the past the timeblock is colored grey. If the event is in the present hour the timeblock is colored red. If the event is in the future then the timeblock is colored green. The user can save the events and the events will persist after the app is closed or refreshed. To use the app, just enter an event into the timeblock for the corresponding hour that your event is planned for and click the save button. The technologies used to create this project were JQuery, HTML, and CSS.
